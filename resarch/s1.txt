To effectively detect accident spots, it is crucial to employ advanced methods and technologies. The literature emphasizes the significance of identifying hot spots or black spots, which are locations prone to accidents (Cheng & Washington, 2008). Machine learning methods, such as the DRAM method, have been proposed for road accident detection, aiding in multiple object detection from image data (Zantalis et al., 2019). Spatial clustering methods, like GIS-based DBSCAN and NNH clustering, play an active role in analyzing speed-related traffic accidents, enabling the detection of common features of hot spot locations (Topcuoglu et al., 2022). Additionally, the integration of cooperative vehicle infrastructure systems has been suggested for automatic car accident detection at intersections, utilizing the Hidden Markov Model (Tian et al., 2019).

Furthermore, the application of deep learning methodology for camera-based blind spot detection systems has been explored, addressing side-swipe accidents caused by blind spot detection (Kwon et al., 2019). Studies have also focused on the development of identification models for road traffic accident black spots, emphasizing the importance of effectively identifying these spots to enhance road traffic safety and reduce accident rates (Cheng et al., 2019). Data mining and complex network algorithms have been utilized for traffic accident analysis, defining hot spots as geographic locations with highly concentrated traffic accidents (Lin et al., 2014).

Moreover, the use of spatial density analysis and the local Moran Index has been proposed to detect black spot zones of traffic accidents, providing valuable tools for planners and decision-makers to allocate resources for accident prevention and safety improvement (Machado et al., 2015). Additionally, the development of accident detection systems using GPS location tracking and IoT technologies has been highlighted, emphasizing the importance of real-time accident detection and reporting systems (Panchani et al., 2021; Pathik et al., 2022). Furthermore, the integration of intelligent systems for accident detection, such as the Accident Detection by an Intelligent System (ADIS), has been proposed to inform emergency contacts through text messages when changes in acceleration, rotation, and force are detected by different sensors (A et al., 2017).

In conclusion, the literature provides a comprehensive overview of various methodologies and technologies for accident spot detection, ranging from machine learning and deep learning approaches to spatial clustering methods and intelligent systems. These approaches aim to enhance road traffic safety by effectively identifying and analyzing accident hot spots.
