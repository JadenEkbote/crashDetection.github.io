### Problem Statment : Crash Detection System
Description:

***Litrature Survey***:
From the Litreature survey we found that the main sensors needed for Crash Detection are: <br /> 
**GPS Module** : 1. The GPS module captures the precise location data during a crash. <br /> 
2. By continuously tracking the speed and movement of the vehicle, the GPS module can help in determining the impact of the crash.<br /> 
3. The GPS module records essential data, such as the vehicle's path, speed, and position before, during, and after the crash.
