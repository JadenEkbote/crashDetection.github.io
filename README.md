### Problem Statment : Crash Detection System
***Description***:
The IoT-Based Crash Detection and Alert System is designed to enhance vehicle safety by leveraging advanced sensor technologies, GPS, and cloud computing. When a crash occurs, the system immediately sends an alert to the cloud, which then notifies nearby emergency services. Simultaneously, the vehicle's GPS coordinates are tracked to provide precise location data. The cloud also maintains a database of accident-prone zones. If a vehicle approaches one of these zones within 200 meters, the system warns the driver via the infotainment system. Should the vehicle exceed the speed limit in these zones, the system automatically disengages the accelerator to maintain a safe speed. This comprehensive approach ensures timely assistance during accidents, alerts drivers about potential hazards, and enforces speed limits in high-risk areas, significantly enhancing overall road safety.

***Litrature Survey***:
From the Litreature survey we found that the main sensors needed for Crash Detection are: <br /> 


**GPS Module** : 1. The GPS module captures the precise location data during a crash. <br /> 
2. By continuously tracking the speed and movement of the vehicle, the GPS module can help in determining the impact of the crash.<br /> 
3. The GPS module records essential data, such as the vehicle's path, speed, and position before, during, and after the crash. 

**Vibration Sensor** : 1. Vibration sensors used in crash detection are highly sensitive and capable of detecting sudden, high-magnitude vibrations indicative of a collision. <br /> 
2. This sensitivity allows for the rapid identification of crash events, triggering safety mechanisms such as airbags and emergency response systems almost instantaneously.<br />
